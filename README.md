feed_engine_front_end
=====================
**Jumpstart Labs Feed Engine Tutorial** 
[http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/feed_engine/feed_engine.html]


A front end app to interact with feed engine auth and feed engine API apps. 

For this project we decided to build several apps to interact with one another to create a dashboard that will show git commit history, pivotal tracker stories, code climate grades and Travis CI builds all in one.  This product is intended for dev teams who would like a way to display relevant information on the progress of a project.
